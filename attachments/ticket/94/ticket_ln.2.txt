Technical changes to CABLE as opposed to trunk 150715

Generally the listed changes have been made to facilitate the
following:

	- Be independent from Met-file to determine Start and
          end-date
	- Be able to run CASA (with any other module like POP,BLAZE..)
	  in CASA_ONLY run to save runtime.
	- be able to spin CASA and CABLE independently
	
	  - spinup with GSWP data
	  - Choose a min number of repetitions for casa over convergence criterion
	    (cable_user%CASA_NREP)
	- added PLUME IO (cable_plume_mip.F90, extra documentation, if desired)
	- added Weathergenerator(cable_weathergenerator.F90, documentation in the Code)
	

cable_common.F90 
  New entries:
     RunIden = 'STANDARD'  ! an identifier for the output file
     MetType = "NA" !
     CANOPY_STRUC !
     SOIL_STRUC !
     POP_out = 'rst' ! POP output type ('epi' or 'rst')
     POP_rst = ' ' !

     CALL_POP               = .FALSE.
     POP_fromZero           = .FALSE.

     CASA_SPIN_STARTYEAR = 1950 ! for spincasa.F90 only
     CASA_SPIN_ENDYEAR   = 1960 ! for spincasa.F90 only
     YEARSTART           = 1950
     YEAREND             = 1960
     CASA_OUT_FREQ       = 365
     CASA_NREP           = 1
     CASA_DUMP_WRITE     = T/F  ! Set TRUE to safe for later runs 
     			   without CABLE
  Routines
     HANDLE_ERR:     Helper routine to capture netcdf-errors
          	     with option to add a message
     GET_UNIT:       Helper to find an unused unit number for the
          	     opening of intermediate files 
     IS_LEAPYEAR:    Logical function to determine whether year is a
     	     	     leapyear
     LEAP_DAY:       Function to add to length of year (1 or 0)
     YMDHMS2DOYSOD:  Convert Year-Month-Day-Hour-Minute-Second to
        	     DayOfYear-SecondOfDay
     DOYSOD2YMDHMS:  see YMDHMS2DOYSOD	     
     LAND2XY:        Converts Land-index to x and y with xdimsize as a
	 	     proxy for resolution


cable_driver.F90

	The case CASA_ONLY ist set for icycle > 10 
	11 C only 
	12 CN only 
	13 CNP
	where there is no CABLE requested.
	It also drives the READ_CASA_DUMP (safed casa-input from a
	previous combined run (1<=icycle<=3).
	
	First of al there are three loops now:
	      SPINLOOP : until any criterion for convergence is met
	      NREP     : Within each spinloop a min number of
	      	       	 repetitions (to make use of gswp2 data)
	      YEAR     : If CABLE_USER%START/ENDYEAR is set cable
	      	       	 will run from start to end. Even for met-files
			 that have a different starting/ending date
			 (as long as the interval is a subset). 
	These settings can be combined any way. 
	In the "IF ( CALL1 )" BLOCK many of the initialisations have
	been put. Also, netCDF GSWP file id's will be cycled.
	PLUME-MIP IO initialisation is done here. (ANYTHING ON PLUME is
	left undocumented for now. Will do later).

	Routines to create netCDF casa output and restart have been
	added: WRITE_CASA_OUTPUT_NC, write_casa_restart_nc
	as well as output and restart for POP: POP_IO
	
	The GLOBFOR_OUT is a special POP-output routine

	Depending on the type of met-file used, the
	close-statements are at different locations in the code.

	Finally, I changed the prepareFiles and renameFiles routines a
	little bit.
	

casa_cable.F90
	 Here, ncdf_dump and read_casa_dump have been resurrected and
	 modified, as we do need them to test developments that only
	 have a direct feedback with casa.
	 [the two cases should be merged!!!]


GENERAL:
I tried hard to keep all the original functionality in driver so that
no one needs to adapt to this version. This is also the reason why the
code is by no means beautiful. I have a couple of things on my list to
make it a bit easier to read and I am happy to do so in the near
future, but there is currently no time. 
Of course, it is impossible to forsee each and every option or
possible failure. We have been using this code quite a while and 
have removed bugs that we found, but our way of using it might be 
different from e.g. Aspendale demands.

New MPI files are not yet finalised.
 
I strongly suggest making use of the "ONLY" tag everytime when using modules!
  - it's safer
  - makes code much more readable

areas modified by Lars are within the following brackets:
!--- LN ------------------------------------------[
!--- LN ------------------------------------------]

areas modified by Vanessa start with:
!! VH !!

Variables whose names names to be changed:
NRRRR
RRRR
RYEAR

Variable naming convention violations from my side are mainly CAPITAL
names. We should change that -> all lower case.
